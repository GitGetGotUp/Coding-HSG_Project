# Coding-HSG_Project

This is a group project for the HSG course:
3,793 | 4,799: Skills: Programming - Introduction Level. 

We took the economics data set from the tidyverse library, global_economy data set
from the tsibbledata library and the USREC data set from the FRED St. Louis, joined them and tried to
forecast personal consumption expenditure inflation adjusted and per capita of the US-Economy using ML-tools in R.

We followed the techniques and principles outlines in:
Hyndman, R.J., & Athanasopoulos, G. (2021) Forecasting: principles and practice,
3rd edition, OTexts: Melbourne, Australia. OTexts.com/fpp3. Accessed on <26.12.2021>.

Any redistribution or copies of our code are not allowed as it is for a uni project. 

The Repo contains the following files:
- economicsv6.r: final R code script of our group
- project_paper.pdf: final project paper to supplement code script
- us_recession.csv: external dataset from the FRED St. Louis
